# Digital Canvas
A small script that recognizes digits you draw using tensorflow and the mnist dataset

I made this project to learn about tensorflow and to burn off an afternoon. The goal was simply to do something
cool with tensorflow and python and have some fun.

# Features
* Draw different digits from `0-9` and you should see the predicted digit at the bottom right.
* You can draw, earse and clear the whole canvas
* Limitless creative potential (as long as it is one of the 10 digits)

# Installation And Usage
Clone the repository to your system, make sure you have `numpy`, `PIL`, `tkinter` and `tensorflow` installed
and run `python digital_canvas/main.py`

Use the toolbar at the top to change into an eraser and back, try different pen sizes and see how the model reacts
